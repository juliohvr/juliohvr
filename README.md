I am interested in Robotics and Bioengineering. A holistic approach can lead to developing optimal systems. 
The co-design of cyber-physical systems must take into account the biological and mechanical models, hardware, and software.
I'm searching for the application of mathematical representation of models by algebraic geometry, topology, and energy fields. 
The study of mathematical concepts can lead to hardware and software design that solve complex dynamical systems.
